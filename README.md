# Healthy Stall API 🍏🛒

Healthy Stall API is a Spring Boot Java REST API, initially developed as a pet project at my previous workplace. This application is not just a concept but a testament to community trust and engagement, effectively managing a healthy food stall. With an emphasis on trust-based transactions, the API facilitates users to deposit money into a physical box and digitally record these transactions. Users can then use their updated balance to purchase items from the stall's inventory. This project is fully tested, ensuring reliability and efficiency in its operation.

## Features 🌿

- **Trust-Based Transactions**: Users self-report their cash deposits, fostering a community built on trust.
- **Balance Management**: Users can view and update their balance after making a deposit.
- **Inventory Search and Purchase**: Explore and buy from a variety of healthy food options available in the stall's inventory.
- **Weekly Management Rotation**: Community involvement with a rotating responsibility for stall management.
